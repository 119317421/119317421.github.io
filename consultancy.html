  <h1>Hyperautomation</h1>
        <p>First, a definition of hyperautomation is in place. Hold on to your hats while we hurl through some technical lingo.
According to Gartner’s report on Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2020, hyperautomation is “the combination of multiple machine learning, packaged software and automation tools to deliver work” and it “deals with the application of advanced technologies including AI and machine learning to increasingly automate processes and augment humans.”</p>

  </div>
         <p>In addition to extending across a range of tools, hyperautomation also refers to the sophistication, or steps, of automation (i.e., discover, analyze, design, automate, measure, monitor, reassess.)</p>
         <p>In that sense, hyperautomation is an expansion of automation in both breadth and depth. Gartner explain it as going from thinking of automation as ‘simply’  RPA and task automation to thinking of automation as highly sophisticated, AI-based process automation to the level that organizations are building ‘digital twins’.</p>

<div id="Multiexperience" class="tabcontent">
  <h1>Multiexperience</h1>
         <p>Gartner has placed Multiexperience amongst the top technology trends of 2020. As per the analyst, the multiexperience trend will replace technology-literate people with people-literate technology. Instead of people getting accustomed to the evolving technologies, it will so happen that the technology will evolve to understand the people better. 
Multiexperience is about leveraging various modalities, digital touchpoints, apps, and devices to design and develop a seamless experience for the customers. The idea is to interact with the customers at as many touch points as possible to offer a consistent customer experience across the web, mobile, app, and other modalities. </p>
<div>

  </div>
        <p>Thinking of multiexperience to be same as omnichannel is a rather common mistake. While omnichannel involves tapping the user touch points across all the channels, multiexperience is about developing effortless customer experiences across apps, websites, and modalities of voice, touch, and text, irrespective of the channel. 
The key difference between omnichannel and multiexperience is the core. Omnichannel is all about technology, whereas, multiexperience is all about people. This difference marks the shift from technology-literate people to people-literate technology. </p>

<div id="Cloud" class="tabcontent">
  <h1> Distributed Cloud</h1>
      <p>When you are running a small to medium sized business, it is likely that you get a lot of advice as to how to streamline and optimize your operation. While often that advice may be unsolicited – and inaccurate for your situation – one area you may want to explore is how you approach your IT and network solutions.
Unless you are an IT person yourself, it is nearly impossible to keep up with the ever-evolving technology advancements. Trying to keep up with the hardware, software, storage and security innovations is seemingly an insurmountable task when you have all the other areas of the business to manage. One of the newest buzzwords is distributed cloud computing.</p>
